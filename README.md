# What is a State?
->The state object is where you store property values that belong to the component.
When the state object changes, the component re-renders.

->Hooks are a set of predefined functions that  let you use state and other React features without writing a Function .
->Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. 

# What is UseState? 
->UseState is one of the built-in react hooks available in 0.16.7 version.
->During the initial render, the returned state (state) is the same as the value passed as the first argument (initialState).

# What is SetState ?
->The setState function is used to update the state. It accepts a new state value and enqueues a re-render of the component.
